This is an introductory course on database technology. The purpose of this course is to provide hands-on experience in database management and design. Topics will include database concepts, data modeling, relational database development, SQL, the application of popular database systems software, some additional topics on more advanced database technology and data warehouses. After taking this class, students should have a grasp on the following major subjects in database management:

* Conceptual modeling (Entity-Relationship model)
* Logical modeling (Relational database model)
* SQL
* Data warehousing

## Learning Objectives
* Analyze the impact of data management on sustainability.
* Design database systems that incorporate sustainability principles addressing environmental, social, and economic challenges.
* Collaborate on interdisciplinary projects that synthesize database management with sustainable development.

<!---Students will be first grounded in the core of the Python computer programming language. Later in the semester, the course will turn to apply Python to important tasks routinely included in data science workflows, such as tasks relating to data wrangling (processing and transforming data in order to derive an informative and manageable data set).--->

<!---While covering core concepts like univariate and multivariate forecasting/evaluation of forecasts is critical, I believe we should also cover topics like approaching a forecasting a problem, wrangling with time series data/objects, advanced topics like neural networks for time series, hierarchical data, and practical issues when approaching a problem and implementing a solution.--->


<!---This is a course in the analysis of time series data with emphasis on the appropriate choice of models for estimation, testing, and forecasting. Topics or methodologies covered include Univariate Box-Jenkins for fitting and forecasting time series; ARIMA models, stationarity and nonstationarity; diagnosing time series models; transformations; forecasting: point and interval forecasts; seasonal time series models; modeling volatility with ARCH, GARCH; modeling time series with trends; and other methods. --->
